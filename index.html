      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm currently reading the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. It's interesting but seems a little harsh at times given his goal more or less was to make people question thier faith.</p>
      <p>He specifically says he wont be handling any issues with kid gloves and makes valid arguements why he shouldn't but it still seems like the book is written more for validation of atheist beliefs than to open minds of those with faith.</p>
